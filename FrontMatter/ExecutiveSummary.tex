\singlespacing
The Mechanical Engineering Graduate Association (MEGA) administered its second annual quality of life survey from March 7th, 2018 to March 23rd, 2018. MEGA received 79 responses from 42 doctoral ME students, 22 masters ME students, 1 doctoral BME student, 2 doctoral alumni and 12 masters alumni. The responses represent 55\% of current doctoral ME students, and 22\% of current masters ME students.

Based on the results of the survey, MEGA identified several key issues to address with the department on behalf of the student body. The requests cover the highest priority and most widespread problems uncovered by the survey that cannot be corrected by MEGA alone. The key issues are listed below.
